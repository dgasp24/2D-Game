## Summary
  This is a 2D retro game project to help give me a refresher to Java. I want to be able to refine my skills in Java as well and potentially learn some new things along the way while wathching the tutorial. I am current Sophomore at UTSA and I am hoping that these skills that I am refining and learning can also help me create my own projects that I can put on my resume.

## Updating the code
I will commit to github with each video I watch so that I can keep track of my progress.
I am creating this repository on episode #7, so I do have a good amount done.
I have created so far from Episode #7:
  - `Entity Class`
    - Supersecedes the Player class
      
  - `Player Class`
    -  Player has animations and also is detected for collision
    -  Also is controllable with WASD
      
  - `Tile Manager`
    -  Created an array for the images that contain the tiles
      
  - `Map Loader`
    - With the array it loads the map with a loop
          
  - `Collision Detector Class`
    -  Creates an invisible rectantagle within the player image that detects if that image collides with other tiles
      
  -  `Game Panel Class`
    - Holds the entire game together
       - Contains the game loop and the screen in which you actually play
   
- I do not plan on updating this part of the READ-ME due to the fact the game will be bigger and you will see my updates of the game whenever I commit the code to github.
